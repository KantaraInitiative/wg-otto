# Kantara OTTO Charter

## WG NAME

Open Trust Taxonomy for Federation Operators (OTTO)

## PURPOSE

The OTTO working group seeks to define an interoperable technical solution that will enable the operation of federations 
within a trusted ecosystem of autonomous entities, creating a foundation of trust, and lowering the cost of 
collaboration. 

The effort will concentrate on three areas: (1) definition of endpoints to enable the creation and update
of federations. (2) A extensible JSON-LD data design to enable the definition of federation entities, 
schema, and trust relationships. (3) Mechanisms to cryptographically verify the integrity of the federation 
data.

The Work Group seeks to design a solution usable by existing SAML federations, PKI federations and 
the OAuth ecosystem.

Specifically, this Work Group is responsible for:
* Developing a set of core use cases 
* Developing of the OTTO Core specification defining the endpoints, data model, and digital signing requirements.

The group will target completion of the draft specification by 12/31/16, and final specification by 12/31/17. 

## SCOPE

The APIs and data structures will enable discovery of the members of the federation and details 
about their services, key material and technical capabilities. The final scope will be refined 
after delivery of the final confirmed use cases

## DRAFT TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

The following technical specifications should be produced, with modular spec boundaries subject to change.  The 
specifications will then be submitted to appropriate standards bodies for further work and completion:
 
- Open Trust Taxonomy for OAuth2 Use Cases
- Open Trust Taxonomy for OAuth2 Core Metadata and Protocol

## LEADERSHIP

- Co-Chair, Michael Schwartz
- Co-Chair, Janusz Ulanowski, HEAnet

## AUDIENCE

Existing federation operators and any group of autonomous organizations that need to establish common policies and 
procedures to establish a basis for trust and faciliate electronic collaboration.

## DURATION 

Working Group would decide whether to dissolve, or consider future enhancements, after the release of the first 
final release the OTTO Core standard.

## IPR POLICY 

Option Patent and Copyright Reciprocal Royalty Free with Opt-Out to (RAND)

## RELATED WORK AND LIAISONS 

There is an existing multi-party federation standard for SAML. The WG will also leverage the UMA 1.0.1 and 
OpenID Connect 1.0 standards. The work of the JSON-LD W3C group will also be incorporated.
