# Kantara OTTO Charter

## WG NAME

Open Trust Taxonomy for Federation Operators (OTTO)

## PURPOSE and SCOPE

The OTTO working group seeks to define an inter operable technical solution to
help federation participants and operators to more efficiently enroll, update,
and share information.

The WG will focus on three areas: (1) definition of API's for federation
management; (2) A extensible JSON-LD vocabulary to standardize the data
representation of federation entities; (3) Mechanisms to cryptographically
verify the integrity of federation data and messages.

The Work Group seeks to design a solution initially useful to existing SAML
federations and OAuth ecosystems, while supporting extensions to meet future
requirements.

Specifically, this Work Group will seek to:
* Interview experts in who can provide feedback on requirements and solutions.
* Specify the required and optional features of an OTTO API request and response.
* Develop a Core JSON-LD vocabulary for OTTO, as well as SAML and OpenID Connect.
* Find a federation to adopt / implement OTTO

The group will target completion of the draft specification by 12/31/18, and
final specification by 6/30/19.
