## Name Change / Charter

Name change to "Open Trust Taxonomy for Federation Operators" will be put to a official

## Discussion of updated proposal

[Current Proposal](https://github.com/KantaraInitiative/wg-otto/blob/master/docs/proposal/proposal.md)

Since last week had a lot of absences, we re-reviewed the proposal updates. See minutes from 5/25/16
for a review. 

Some of the items that elicited additional conversation:

1. Query filter syntax. A few suggestions were made, including (1) CQL https://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/cql
(2) JSON Query Language http://jsoniq.org/ and (3) SCIM Query Syntax 
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644#section-3.4.2 and (4) Linked Data Query Syntax
http://www.linkeddatatools.com/querying-semantic-data

2. Yuriy suggested that we build versioning into the Schema publication, lest applications
relying on schema get broken. Solution needs to be flushed out.

3. Judith pointed out that we should have both stable identifiers (like 
guids) and human understandable versions was to reference the federations entities.

4. Mike pointed out that there were two aspects to integrity: (1) how can the federation add 
trust to the information provided by the entity; (2) how can the federation metadata itself b
be trusted. For the former, Mike made a case that hashing is the simplest strategy; for the 
latter, linked data signing is currently propoposed. It has risks, but at the same time, it
could have some interesting applications--like signing a portion of the data. 

## Next steps

1. Mike is going to update the charter and mail out for an official vote by the end of the week.
2. Keith to review the use cases. We may want to file the old use cases as "unvalidated". Mike proposed 
the use cases as (1) Core Federation, (2) Inter-Federation (3) Schema Management
3. Yuriy to work on endpoint definitions for the /organization and /schema endpoints
4. Judith to await the arrival of her worldly possessions
5. Mike is looking to bring on another resource from Gluu to assist in writing the spec. Yuriy
will stay on of course, but we need someone else to help with the writing.
