## Special Guest
- Jane Celusak
- Rainer Hörbe

## Topics discussed

Jane offered to answer any questions related to setting up our WG. We talked about the nominiation process
for roles, which is still underway. She suggested that we open nominations for roles the week of 9/2 - 9/8,
hold voting the week of 9/9-9/15.

Judith and I discussed the positions, and our suggestion is that we have two co-chairs and an editor. We can
continue this discussion next week when we have quorum.

Attendance has been low because of summer vacations. Mike is anxious to get started. All voting members
please make an effort to attend so we can make quorum!

Next week would be a good time to review our core use cases and start to decide which are "must-have" or
"nice-to-have."
