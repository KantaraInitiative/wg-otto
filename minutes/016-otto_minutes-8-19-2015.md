## Topics discussed


NOMINATIONS / VOTING
We will open nominations for roles the week of 9/2 - 9/8, hold voting the week of 9/9-9/15.
Roles will be two co-chairs and specification editor. Need to follow-up to ask
about if there is a system available to handle our vote.

1) Scope / Schedule

Entity discovery is the most important use case:
  1) How would the federation give access to members to write to a tree?

  2) Entity / member data structure?

  3) Federation description data structure? Is it just an entity?
      a) How a federation would publish what user attributes, openid scopes,
       uma scopes, acr's and amr's are available?

  4) How will the data be published--blockchain

  5) How can you query? By id? What about entity-based attribute based queries?
     For example, return all the OpenID Connect Relying Parties. Rainer mentioned
     perhaps a query to return RP's with a certain sector_identifier.

  6) Description of the trust models : hierarchical, peer-to-peer. How would trust
  be established using the OTTO data structure / standard.

Metadata publication is a solution to a larger problem, for example, business rules, enrollment.

Peer to peer trust models exist for certificates, where you could see who else trusts an entity.
Replication rating in stack exchange... or social network.

Perhaps if there is visibility on who trusts who, it could enable the creation of many trust models.

Jim posted a link to an article on a minimum viable blockchain:

Rainer mentioned that we need to consider the time aspect of any trust network. For example, maybe I trusted
you last week, but not this week.

2) OpenID Connect Thread on "claims" in the Client Registration Spec?
