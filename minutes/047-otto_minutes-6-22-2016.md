## Charter / Name Change

Mike's motions for approval of the new 
[charter](https://github.com/KantaraInitiative/wg-otto/blob/master/kantara/charter2.md)
and for a name change to the "Open Trust Taxonomy for Federation Operators"
was seconded by Keith without objections from the group. We will submit this to the 
Kantara Leadership Council for final approval.

## Discussion of updated proposal

[Current Proposal](https://github.com/KantaraInitiative/wg-otto/blob/master/docs/proposal/proposal.md)

Yuriy provided an overview of the endpoints for /schema and /organization. Included in the 
discussion was a strategy to use major and minor version numbers to help federations
document changes to the schema. 

Janusz suggested that we define a discovery mechanism, for example, `.well-known/otto-configuration`
where an RA can specify the endpoints or publish other discovery information, like signing 
mechanisms supported.

## AI's for next week

1. Keith to continue review of use cases
2. Meg to start on node-js implementation 
3. Yuriy to work on discovery endpoint, and to research query syntax for federation_entity
4. Mike to update diagram for discovery endpoint
