## Discussion of Re-Charter

Rainer suggested last year that we re-charter to expand the scope of the working group to cover 
SAML federation and X.509 certificate trust use cases. He suggested we add the following paragraph to 
the charter:

    The design will support interoperability with other trust taxonomies such as SAML metadata and X.509 
    certificates. An underlying layer independent from OAuth2/SAML/X509 will enable the sharing of common data 
    elements. Another goal is to allow the operation of many federations within an instance of the trust taxonomy, 
    thus allowing an entity to be part of multiple federations.
    
Mike will also update the other references in the charter to OAuth2.

## Discussion of Schema

Judith committed this
