# Discussion of Schema

Judith began by pointing to the http://schema.org definition of Organization.
  [https://schema.org/Organization](https://schema.org/Organization)
  [https://schema.org/parentOrganization](https://schema.org/parentOrganization)
  
Some of the interesting attributes to consider are "member", "memberOf" and "additionalType".
Should we try to use additionalType to define the services of an organization? Or should we
extend organization for a new object like "FederationParticipant"

Janusz proposed an idea for defining SAML entities, which we edited during the meeting.

    {
      "@context": {
        "schema": "http://schema.org",
        "otto": "http://example.com/ottovocabulary#",
        "otto:validUntil": {
          "@type": "xsd:dateTime"
        }
      },
      "otto:fedname": "Example Federation name",
      "otto:validUntil": "2015-12-23T12:55:17Z",
      "otto:members": [
        { 
          "@id": "f82142a5-510c-4c80-a6ae-9424d9a0903d",
          "schema:parentOrganization": 
            {@id: "cfbed246-d947-4ba4-8e97-50a60e38a2e4"
            },
          "otto:entityType": "SAML IDP",
          "otto:entityID": "https://idp.member1.ie/idp",
          "otto:metadataURL": "https://idp.member1.ie/idp"
          "otto:metadataHash": "b36b272da341b360b441"
        }
      ]
    }


One question that arose was whether data could be distributed and hashed. In the example above, could 
the IDP publish the metadata, and the federation would just include a hash of the contents? 

Another interesting question was whether organizations should be the top entries of a federation. In SAML, the entity
data is very flat--if an organization has 10 entities (let's say one IDP and nine websites), the organization element
would be in each. For Example

      <Organization>
        <OrganizationName xml:lang="en">Example Org.</OrganizationName>
        <OrganizationDisplayName xml:lang="en">Example Schools Inc.</OrganizationDisplayName>
        <OrganizationURL xml:lang="en">http://www.example.edu</OrganizationURL>
      </Organization>

Keith explained that this was viewed as easier for operational consumption of the data--each entity
was self-contained. But would it be better to reduce data duplication to use the linking capabilities of JSON-LD?
Also, flat data could be rendered from JSON-LD metadata for backwards compatibility. 

# Discussion on extending effort to SAML / PKI

Mike likes the idea, but asked if we could define this as Phase II? SAML has a lot of schema that we'd need 
to convert. Rainer was travelling today, so we'll get more feedback from him hopefully in the next meeting.
