# JSON-LD Signature discussion

Mike did some research last week on JSON-LD signatures, and it looks encouraging.
In particular, there is an approach to convert JSON-LD to RDF, and then to 
normalize and sign the RDF. See the working group drafts here:
 [http://json-ld.org/spec/latest](http://json-ld.org/spec/latest)

What is the difference betwen Canonicalization and normalization? 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonicalization](Wikipedia definition): 
  In computer science, canonicalization (sometimes standardization or normalization) is a process 
  for converting data that has more than one possible representation into a "standard", "normal", 
  or canonical form. This can be done to compare different representations for equivalence, to count 
  the number of distinct data structures, to improve the efficiency of various algorithms by 
  eliminating repeated calculations, or to make it possible to impose a meaningful sorting order.

Alan mentioned that dealing with whitespace was a particular challenge in efforts to 
normalize RDF. Tools had different conventions, and people would adjust whitespace for 
readability. 

Manu Sporny, one of the editors will be a special guest next week. We can pose this question to him. 
 
Please watch this quick video by Manu on JSON-LD signatures:

He is also working on an effort to use JSON-LD signautres to enable personal
identification: OpenCreds:

As we may not have the benefits of Manu's expertise in the future, if you have any questions 
about JSON-LD, please prepare them for next week. Also please attend!
