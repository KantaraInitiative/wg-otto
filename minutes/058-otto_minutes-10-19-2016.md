## Discussion of Signing

Signing is possible using `sign=true` param on federation metadata
or query results. Yuriy Z suggested to add a param called `kid`. 
If omitted, kid should default to RS512.

## Janusz comments

* "I get impression from guys from other federations that every other 
NREN/Federation will come with own solution to publish metadata if 
needed."

Some common denominator of schema would be useful. OTTO should allow 
a mechanism to extend schema, or to push a JSON object (that would
not be changed). 

* "I found an issue with json-ld - current version doens't allow to 
attach json object and keep it unchanged during transformation like 
expanding - which is an issue if we want to add pu
re json to our metadata. As far I know json-ld 1.1 will likely have 
this possibility."
