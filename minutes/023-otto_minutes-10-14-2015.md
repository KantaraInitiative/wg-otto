## Discussion of Email from Rainer re: collaboration with SAML / PKI

    Subject: Re: [WG-OTTO] OTTO WG Meeting Reminder Tomorrow, Weds 8AM Pacific Time
    Date: 2015-10-13 16:05
    From: Rainer Hoerbe <rainer@hoerbe.at>
    To: Schwartz Mike <mike@gluu.org>
    
    I will try to join, but will be dependent on the quality of the mobile net while out of office.
    
    So I try to convey my thoughts in a few sentences.
    
    SAML metadata, when including the FO’s perspective, is supporting the trust relationships between federation members 
    mediated via multiple elementary assertions. SAML metadata remains on the level of trust between technical entities, 
    moving the link to legal entities to registration processes and unstructured data in <organization>. To have an 
    entity’s metadata published in a federation’s aggregate, these implicit assertions might be:
    - organization is federation member
    - entity operator is authorized by federation member to submit metadata with key material
    - endpoint URLs in entity descriptor are owned by federation member
    - Entity category is vetted by the FO
    
    These are probably assertions that can be reused for the registration system of OTTO and PKI-bridges as well, if the
    semantics can be made interoperable. Examples would be „is federation member“, „owns FQDN“, „is authorized to register
    public keys“. Technology-specific variants could go to produce OTTO on the fly, and support status and dynamic 
    registration processes for SAML and PKI.
    
    Of course, the individual claim should go into a public ledger. Ideally, notaries and government registries would 
    write assertions to the same block chain (now jumping 50 years ahead).

## Discussion of Schema from Janusz

We walked through the [diagram](https://github.com/KantaraInitiative/wg-otto/raw/master/files/janusz_proposed_schema.pdf). 
The federation operator would link to entities and other federations. 
One of the nice features of this design is that the entity metadata is only stored in one place, rather 
than copied to each federation. The diagram is not complete. For example, the federation operator may
be authoritative for certain data about an entity (like categories).

## Discussion of potential data structures

Mike is concerned that if we design a solution without an implementation in parallel, we may miss
important requirements. Mike had mentioned [Falcor](http://netflix.github.io/falcor/documentation/jsongraph.html), but 
its just an idea. Judith suggested we look at JSON Linked Data: [http://json-ld.org](http://json-ld.org)

Mike did a quick google search on merkle tree / blockchain and turned up one open source project:
[https://github.com/chainpoint/chainpoint](https://github.com/chainpoint/chainpoint)

Homework for next week is to look a litle more deeply at these technologies.
