## Meeting minutes

Mike's motions to approve minutes from 11/4 and 10/21 was seconded by Judith. Mike sends his apologies for 
not sending out the minutes via email, but they were checked into Github 
[here](https://github.com/KantaraInitiative/wg-otto/blob/master/minutes/025-otto_minutes-11-4-2015.md) if 
you missed them.

## Discussion of Linked Data

    { "@context": "https://kantarainitiative.org/json-ld/otto-schema.json",
      "@id": "https://example.org/idp-federation-data.json",
      "Name": "",
      "Expires": "11/11/2016"
    }

`@context` field of linked data document specifies the schema. 
`@id` is the global identifier

Other syntax for JSON-LD can be found in the [specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#syntax-tokens-and-keywords)

JSON-LD looks like a good place to start. We have a way to define our schema, to globally identify 
entities, and to link entities. Kudos to Judith for suggesting it! 

The OTTO spec should specify syntax carefully enough so that it can be parsed, data like phone numbers and address 
present a particular challenge due to their compound nature. Some of the data may be simple strings, 
but other data may need more complex definitions. We'll have to dig futher into the spec to figure 
out how to best accomplish this.

Judith put together this 
[interesting diagram](https://github.com/KantaraInitiative/wg-otto/blob/master/files/saml-otto-schema-hierarchy.png)
on SAML schema versus how OTTO schema may work:
 

## Discussion of Blockchain

After much deliberation, Mike contends that we can move ahead with the data structure, and figure out
later how to publish to the metadata. 

One of the challenges is how the federation can point to the current metadata for an entity. Depending
on the blockchain technology used, its possible that old transactions may be purged after a certain
period of time to keep the data set small. TBD, but we may need to include into the blockchain a pointer
to the identifier of the entity + a hash value of the contents.

## Discussion of Rainer's requirements

Reiner started this 
[use case doc](https://github.com/KantaraInitiative/wg-otto/blob/master/docs/sources/requirements/requirements.md)

### R1. Technology-Independent Claims

Basically the idea is that OTTO could be used to solve problems in SAML and PKIX. This is a nice to have,
but the last O in OTTO is "OAuth2". We could change the name to OTT (Open Trust Taxonomy)...
But everyone agrees that if we can solve SAML and PKIX challenges too, that would be great.

### R2. Triple-Format for Claims

If we were to proceed with the JSON-LD format, we could establish relationships between the items.
For example, entity-is-member, in the (subject,verb,object) form. The subject and object would be 
the @id identifiers of the JSON-LD. 

This section needs some examples. Membership is clearly one relationship we want, but what 
others would be in scope?

Judith pointed out that there are certain standard schema that has been defined by RDF
[here](http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#syntax-tokens-and-keywords)

## Action Items for next week
 
 - Keith to work on SAML metadata 
 - Mike to work on OpenID Connect / UMA metadata
 - Judith will also help on schema / entity relationship mapping offline, although she 
 can't make the meeting next week.
