OTTO WG Minutes: 5/4/2018
STATUS: Draft

## Voting Members Attending:
 - Mike Schwartz
 - Keith Hazelton
 - Judith Bush

## Apress Book

Mike is going to release a draft of the chapter on Multiparty federations,
hopefully before the I2 meeting next week. He will post to the OTTO WG
list and the refeds list for comments. The chapter positions OTTO favorably. 

## EIC

Kantara is doing a workshop at EIC. Mike will present the same slides he
has been using: https://gluu.co/otto-2018

## Adoption

At this point, the most important thing is to find an ecosystem that needs
OTTO. It will probably be an ecosystem that is adopting OAuth first, like
open banking. We're not expecting higher ed to adopt because they have
tons of SAML content.
