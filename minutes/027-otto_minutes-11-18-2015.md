## SAML -> JSON

Keith converted some SAML metadata to JSON, and we spent some time looking at it. 

# JSON-LD

Keith mentioned that JSON LD is being used by the IMS Global Learning Consortium, 
for an interoperability specification for dtaa analytics from digital educational use
cases. Here is a [press release](https://www.imsglobal.org/pressreleases/pr150506.html)

## Triples Discussion

Rainer proposed that all federation metadata be exposed as triples to enable better searching and 
analysis of metadata. A discussion ensued about whether JSON-LD could be used to express these
triples, or if we are suggesting that the serialization format should be RDF. 

Example of triplse are: 
Federation -- hasMember -- Entity 
Entity - owns - public key

However, each attribute could be expressed as a triple.  For example, 
(Entity, has, endpoint) to define the Assertion Consumer Endpoint? 

Allen raised an issue that its hard to sign RDF. Who would we sign these triples? JSON can be signed. 
But if the order of the elements is different, the signatures would be different. Would OTTO need
to define the order to enable canonicalization. Alan mentioned that he worked on an RDF hash strategy 
(with canonicalization) that used set hash, which is weaker, but does require ordering. Here is the link:

Mike asked if we need triples for everything, or do we need triples just to express the relationship 
between the entities.

Rainer offered to submit some examples of how we could express SAML metadata schema in triples format.
