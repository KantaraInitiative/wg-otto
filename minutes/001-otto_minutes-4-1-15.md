# OTTO Minutes #1

## Attendees

* Michael Schwartz
* Janusz Ulanowki

## Notes

1. Agreement on the need to create a new profile of OAuth2 that enables a domain to act as the central trust registry for OpenID Connect Providers, OpenID Connect Clients, UMA Resource Servers, UMA Authorization Servers, UMA clients and perhaps other entities that are deemed necessary.

2. During the upcoming IIW workshop in Mountain View, CA, Mike will work to get the support of Internet2 and Uninet to join Edugate as the sponsoring members for the new Kantara Working Group. 

3. Mike proposed a schedule to attempt to complete a standard in one year, in time for RSA 2016. 

4. Tentative agreement that 9AM CT will be a recurring time for WG calls. Next call is scheduled for 4/15.

5. Agreement that project artifacts should be maintained in github. To get started, Mike created a public github project at:
 https://github.com/nynymike/otto

6. To document the schema and API's, Mike proposed using mkdocs, which uses markdown to generate a nicely formated html site. The benefit of mkdocs is good readability on Github, but also an easy way to export plain html. 

7. IIW may be a convenient time to draft the charter, to scope the APIs, and to brainstorm the schema formats.
