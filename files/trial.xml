      <section title="Introduction">
        <t>There are scenarios in which relying parties would like to know researcher identifiers like ORCID for users accessing their services. If the relying party opts to accept ORCID values from external sources, there is a benefit to agreeing on a standard representation of an ORCID identifier. ORCID values might be included in a SAML attribute assertion provided by an Identity Provider to a Relying Party on behalf of a user. The eduPersonOrcid attribute specification in this document is based on the style of attribute specification associated with the <xref target="EDUPERSON" /> work of MACE-Dir. If an IdP includes this attribute in their local directory copy of the eduPerson object class as another optional attribute on person entries, experimental use of this attribute in SAML exchanges can be supported.</t>

        <t>ORCID identifiers are meant to uniquely identify the researcher to whom they are registered, so they are personally identifying information by design.

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
